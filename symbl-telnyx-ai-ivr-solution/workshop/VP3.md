# AI IVR Workshop

## Symbl Prerequisites

Symbl is an AI-powered, API first, Conversation Intelligence platform for natural human conversations that works on audio, video, and textual content in real-time or recorded files. Symblâ€™s APIs let you generate real-time Sentiment Analysis, Action Items, Topics, Trackers, Summary and much more in your applications.

For full documentation and resources on the kinds of things that Symbl is able to do with it's AI powered voice recognition and analysis, check out the descriptive documentation shown here: https://docs.symbl.ai/docs/
***
For now, we will need to get access to the API. To do so, we simply:

1. Sign up and create an account on the [Symbl Platform](https://platform.symbl.ai/#/login)
2. Once your account has been created, you can find what we need right on the front page: the API Credentials. Jot down:
    * App ID
    * App Secret

That's it!

You are now ready to [proceed to the next step](./VP4.md).
